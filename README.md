# Functions
Function is the building block of any programming language.
Function helps in creating a reusable code you can access anytime, anywhere
In this work, we use functions to create four basic arithmetic operation
This operatons are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

# For...of loop
For loops are very eseential when it comes to readable and concise code
However, there are different for loops which includes;
basic for loop, for...in loop, for...of loop, for...each loop
In this project, we made use of for...of loop which is suitable for arrays.
The for...loop runs through the array of operations and execute it accordingly.
